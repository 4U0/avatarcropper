how do u get it to run...?

first make sure u got npm

then clone the repo and u can run `npm install` inside there and then u can do the following:

`npm run build` to build everything

`npm run serve` to locally serve, will open it up in ur browser even

`npm run watchtsc` runs typescript compiler in watch mode so u dont gotta run build every time

`npm run watchsass` does the same for sass

ok thats it have fun
